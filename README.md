View functions
**def home_view(request):**

1.	Function Signature: The function home_view takes a request object as its parameter, which is a HttpRequest object representing the current HTTP request.
2.	Fetching Products: It fetches all the products from the database using the models.Product.objects.all() method. This retrieves all the product objects from the Product model.
3.	Checking Product Count in Cart: It checks if there are any product IDs stored in the user's cookies. If there are, it splits the IDs into a list and counts the unique product IDs to determine the number of products in the cart. If there are no product IDs in the cookies, it sets the product count in the cart to 0.
4.	User Authentication Check: It checks if the user is authenticated (logged in). If the user is authenticated, it redirects them to the 'afterlogin' page using HttpResponseRedirect.
5.	Rendering the Template: If the user is not authenticated, it renders the 'index.html' template with the following context:
•	'products': A queryset containing all the products fetched from the database.
•	'product_count_in_cart': The count of products in the user's cart, which will be displayed on the page.
Overall, the home_view function fetches all products from the database and checks if there are any products in the user's cart. If the user is authenticated, it redirects them to another page; otherwise, it renders the home page with the list of products and the product count in the cart.

**def adminclick_view(request):**
1.	Function Signature: The adminclick_view function accepts a request object, which represents the current HTTP request.
2.	User Authentication Check: It first checks whether the user is authenticated or not using request.user.is_authenticated. If the user is authenticated, it means they are already logged in.
3.	Redirects: If the user is authenticated, it redirects them to the 'afterlogin' URL. This is typically the homepage or dashboard page after logging in.
4.	Redirects to Admin Login: If the user is not authenticated (i.e., they are not logged in), it redirects them to the 'adminlogin' URL. This is likely the login page for administrators.
Overall, the purpose of the adminclick_view function is to control the navigation flow based on the authentication status of the user. If the user is logged in, they are redirected to the appropriate page; otherwise, they are redirected to the admin login page.

**def customer_signup_view(request):**

1.	Forms Initialization: The function starts by initializing two forms: CustomerUserForm and CustomerForm. These forms are used for collecting user and customer information during the registration process.
2.	Form Submission Handling: When the HTTP request method is POST (i.e., the user has submitted the registration form), the function proceeds to validate the forms.
3.	Form Validation: It validates both the user form and the customer form. If both forms are valid, it proceeds with the registration process.
4.	User Creation and Saving: It saves the user information obtained from the user form. Before saving the user, it hashes the password using set_password to ensure security.
5.	Customer Creation and Linking to User: It saves the customer information obtained from the customer form. Since the customer model has a foreign key relationship with the user model, it sets the user field of the customer model to the newly created user.
6.	Assigning User to Customer Group: It assigns the newly created user to the 'CUSTOMER' group using Django's built-in Group model. This is done to manage permissions and access control.
7.	Redirection: After successful registration, it redirects the user to the 'customerlogin' URL, which presumably leads to the customer login page.
8.	Rendering Signup Form: If the HTTP request method is not POST (i.e., it's GET), or if the form validation fails, it renders the 'customersignup.html' template along with the forms to allow the user to fill in the registration details.
In summary, the customer_signup_view function handles the user registration process by validating the user and customer forms, creating and saving user and customer objects, assigning the user to the 'CUSTOMER' group, and redirecting the user upon successful registration.
**def is_customer(user):**

1.	Function Signature: The is_customer function takes a user object as input, which represents the user whose group membership needs to be checked.
2.	Group Membership Check: Inside the function, it checks whether the user belongs to the 'CUSTOMER' group. It does this by filtering the groups associated with the user to see if there exists a group with the name 'CUSTOMER'.
3.	Return Value: If the user belongs to the 'CUSTOMER' group, the function returns True, indicating that the user is indeed a customer. If the user does not belong to the 'CUSTOMER' group or if there are no groups associated with the user, the function returns False.
This function is typically used in conjunction with Django's user authentication system to control access to certain views or functionalities based on the user's group membership. For example, it might be used as a decorator to restrict access to views that are only meant for customers.

**def afterlogin_view(request):**

1.	Function Signature: The afterlogin_view function accepts a request object, which represents the current HTTP request.
2.	User Role Check: It begins by checking the role of the logged-in user by calling the is_customer function, passing the request.user object as an argument.
3.	Redirecting Based on Role: If the logged-in user is identified as a customer (i.e., belongs to the 'CUSTOMER' group), it redirects them to the URL associated with the customer dashboard or home page, typically named 'customer-home'. If the user does not belong to the 'CUSTOMER' group, it assumes the user is an admin and redirects them to the admin dashboard, typically named 'admin-dashboard'.
4.	Redirection: The function uses Django's redirect function to perform the redirection based on the determined URL for the respective user role.
This function effectively ensures that users are directed to the appropriate page after successfully logging in, depending on whether they are identified as customers or administrators. It centralizes the logic for handling post-login redirection based on user roles.
